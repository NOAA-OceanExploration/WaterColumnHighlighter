## Models and Detection Methods

The system currently supports the following detection models:

| Model | Source | Type | Variants | Specialized for Marine Life |
|-------|--------|------|----------|------------------------------|
| OWLv2 | Google | Zero-shot | base, large | Yes (via prompting) |
| YOLOv8 | Ultralytics | Traditional | nano to xlarge | No (COCO classes) |
| DETR | Facebook | Traditional | resnet50, resnet101, dc5 | No (COCO classes) |
| CLIP | OpenAI | Patch classifier | Uses base detector | Yes (via prompting) |
| Grounding DINO | IDEA Research | Zero-shot | tiny, small, base, medium | Yes (via prompting) |
